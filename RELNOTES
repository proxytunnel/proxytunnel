Proxytunnel 1.9.0 release notes

Proxytunnel 1.9.0 summarizes the development in Proxytunnel over the last
year. It includes many bugfixes and a few new features. This release wouln't
have been possible without the help from the Proxytunnel community, and I
especially would like to thank Dag Wieer for his many patches and fixes.

Proxytunnel 1.9.0 should work on all Posix compliant systems, including Linux
*BSD, Windows and OS X. It can work with 1 proxy (default, and most used)
or with 2 proxies chained together (-r). For information regarding the use
of 2 proxies, why you would want or need this, see Dag's page at:
http://dag.wieers.com/howto/ssh-http-tunneling/

Proxytunnel now supports SSL encryption on 3 different phases in the
connection chain. Between proxytunnel and the primary proxy (-E), between
the local primary and the destination (-e), and between the primary and
secondary proxies (-X)

Proxytunnel supports proxies with Basic (-P/-R) and NTLM (-N) authentication,
and can read the username/password information from the commandline, the
environment or a configfile.

The old -u/--user and -s/--pass options have been deprecated, and replaced
by a single -P/--proxyauth option. This accepts the authentication information
in the format user:password, or will prompt for the password when only the
username is given (omit the ':' sign in this case)

The -U/--uservar -S/--passvar options have been removed, use the environment
variables named in the README file in stead.

Proxytunnel can now also read the proxy configuration from the environment
by reading the HTTP_PROXY (format http://host:port/)
