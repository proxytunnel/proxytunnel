- Allow multiple '-H' options (headers), total size of the headers
  should not exceed 1k.

Changes to proxytunnel version 1.6.3 -- Mon Apr 10 12:48:02 CEST 2006

  readpassphrase.c. This should handle longer passwords on systems
  with broken (crappy) getpass calls (solaris/hpux)

Changes to proxytunnel version 1.6.2 -- Wed Mar  8 10:08:53 CET 2006

- Fix NTLM in stand-alone mode

  openbsd-compat/setproctitle.c, also took in strlcat/strlcpy

- Removed Proctitle override message

- Dropped -n option (dottedquad)
- Small change to make compiler on tandem/hp-nonstop happy
  by Roberto Veldhoven
- Small change to work around broken proxies by Stephane Engel
- Changed client_len from size_t to socklen_t (64bit required)
- Makefile vars now no longer override environment versions
- Cleaned up the output, in quiet mode there are now no messages, in
  normal mode a lot less (unless verbose is on)
- Added proxy-bouncing support, courtesy of Dag Wieers, authentication
  only works on the FIRST proxy, not on a second proxy !!
- Added SSL encryption to the data-layer to fool proxies that do deep-
  packet inspection, by: Alex Peuchert proxytunnel@peuchert.de
- Added -x/--proctitle option, to hide/obfuscate the proxytunnel
  command-line in process-listings. This code is disabled by default
  But can be enabled by uncommenting the define in the Makefile.
  Please test this code on systems available to you :)

  <loic.leguyader@laposte.net>

Changes to proxytunnel version 1.1.1 -- Tue May 14 12:09:07 CEST 2002

- Added a reworked version of Dieter Heiliger's idea to add a switch to
  specify a User-Agent header to the CONNECT message. I made it into a
  generic 'Header' function, so you can add whatever you like to the
  connect string ( --header "MyCustomHeader: Value" )

Changes to proxytunnel version 1.1.0 -- Mon Apr 22 22:58:05 CEST 2002

- Ported new features (like stand-alone mode) to CYGWIN and fixed some
  bugs when running on CYGWIN. The cygwin version differs from the normal
  proxytunnel in these issues:
  	- Syslog isn't used, messages in stand-alone mode are displayed
	  in the window where the proxytunnel proces runs.
	- Proxytunnel doesn't fork into the background on cygwin, so it's
	  logging messages can be seen here, and it can easily be killed
	  using CTRL-C in the window.

- Added Makefile.cygwin for use on CYGWIN platform.

Changes to proxytunnel version 1.1.0 -- Sat Apr 20 16:00:00 CET 2002

- Added the -a (--standalone=INT) option. It is mutually exclusive with
  -i (--inetd), and it instructs proxytunnel to fork in the background
  as a standalone daemon, listening on connections on the specified
  port and forwarding these connections through the specified
  proxy/tunnel.

- Forked base64 encoding code to base64.[ch] file, authentication to
  basicauth.[ch], messaging to messages.c and io handling to io.[ch]

- Tested and ported on Linux(i386/ppc/alpha/sparc), Freebsd(i386),
  Solaris(Sparc) and Mac-OS-X(Darwin/ppc). Created some new makefiles
  for the non-complient systems (Solaris, Darwin)

Changes to proxytunnel version 1.0.8 -- Fri Apr 19 10:25:00 CET 2002

- Fixed help-text when system doesn't support long-options
- Cleaned up some code w.r.t short and/or long options, added includes
  for getopt on freebsd.

- Applied patch from "Andrew Griffiths" <nullptr@tasmail.com> to fix
  possible string format attacks. -- Maniac
- Some code cleanup and reformatting -- Maniac
- Added '-q' / '--quiet' flag to suppress status messages, Proxytunnel
  can now be completely quiet and transparent. (Not when also providing
  the '-v' flag naturally) -- Maniac
- Changed ipbuf size to 16, which should be enough. -- Maniac

Changes to proxytunnel version 1.0.6 -- Thu Nov 22 10:38:10 CET 2001

  Makefile to enable this, patch from: Martin Senft <martin@illicon.de>

  work around broken DNS resolving in some proxies when using DynDNS
  hosts (the -n or --dottedquad option) -- Maniac

Changes to proxytunnel version 1.0.5 -- Mon Nov 19 21:26:45 CET 2001

- Added support for running from inetd, using the --inetd option or
  the -i option. Also some cleanups in the tunneling code -- Muppet

Changes to proxytunnel version 1.0.4 -- Sun Nov 11 00:44:39 CET 2001

- All the code by Jos and Mark now covered under GPL, the few lines of
  base64 code came from mutt (also GPL), so the entire program is now
  covered by the GPL -- Maniac

Changes to proxytunnel version 1.0.3 -- Sat Nov 10 21:36:42 CET 2001

- Supporting GNU getopts, the entire command line processing has
  changed. If you were using an old version, please check up on the
  '--help' option, and update your .ssh/config files :) -- Maniac

- Added a --verbose option, which occasionally can print some
  interesting details -- Maniac

- Due to getopts, some error handling when entering incorrect command
  line options -- Maniac

- In addition to using HTTP auth, which we already had, we can now also
  connect to proxy's that do NOT use HTTP auth, simply do not specify a
  username and password. If you specify these, they will be passed on to
  the proxy, otherwise we won't go into auth phase. -- Maniac

- Added simple 'make install' to the makefile -- Maniac
