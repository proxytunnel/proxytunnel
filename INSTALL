Short guide to installing proxytunnel

On most modern unix systems, use the normal Makefile
On MAC OS X, use Makefile.darwin
If you don't have gnu-getopts, use Makefile.no-gnu-getopts
On windows/Cygwin, use Makefile.cygwin
etc etc...

If you want to enable setproctitle functionality, add a CFLAGS define
-DSETPROCTITLE (uncomment sample in Makefile)

Run make and optionally 'make install'.
If you manually want to install, copy proxytunnel to /usr/local/bin
and optionally the manual-page from the debian-subdirectory to your manpath

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cygwin:

Currently cygwin's openssl isn't in a compilable state, change md4.h and md5.h in /usr/include
and replace 'size_t' with 'unsigned long'
To link the final executable:
gcc -o proxytunnel *.o /lib/libcrypto.dll.a /lib/libssl.dll.a

To run, copy the required dll's from the cygwin-bin dir to the windows system dir,
or the proxytunnel directory (cygcrypto-0.9.8.dll, cygssl-0.9.8.dll, cygwin1.dll )

Setproctitle doesn't work on cygwin (afaik)
